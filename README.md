# 3D-Printermanager
This project was an exam project for my high school Information Technology exam at Lyngby Tekniske Gymnasium (Now renamed to H.C Ørsted Gymnasium, Lyngby).

It is a Ruby on Rails application that manages a time schedule for when students can access a 3D printer. The application has simple user authentication and authorization, and lets users create, read, update and delete reservations in a calendar like format.
